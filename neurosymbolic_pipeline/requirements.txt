# Requirements for Neurosymbolic Pipeline

# Core dependencies (should already be in project)
torch>=1.9.0
numpy>=1.21.0
python-chess>=1.999
Pillow>=8.0.0
tqdm>=4.60.0

# Experiment A: Lichess API (via benchmarking/ground_truth.py)
requests>=2.25.0  # For Lichess Cloud Evaluation API

# Note: Lichess API is free and provides Stockfish evaluation
# No need to install Stockfish binary separately
# Or use python-chess built-in evaluation (less accurate but sufficient)

# For VLM integration (Experiment C)
# These should already be available if using existing benchmarking code
# transformers>=4.20.0  # If needed for VLM calls
