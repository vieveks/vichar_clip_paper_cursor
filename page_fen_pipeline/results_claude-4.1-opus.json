Let me recount the pieces systematically.\n\nActually, upon closer inspection, I notice there's a star marker on the board which might indicate whose turn it is, but I should focus on the piece positions.\n\nGiven the complexity and the diagonal shading pattern making it difficult to read some pieces with complete certainty, I must respond:\n\nUNCERTAIN",
